The  `MyCave`  Project
======================

This section is here only to include `Grok` in the documentation. 
It is not relevant for Python beginners.

`MyCave` is an example `Grok` project. It is included in this lb work directory skeleton because LiveBase project often start from the `Grok` buildout. In the future (from 2013-03-03 on) the structure of this skeleton itself should make it clear that the egg named `MyCave` and corresponding names in this skeleton are just  placeholders for the names appearing in another `Grok` based project.
