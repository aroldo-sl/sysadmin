Globalization
=============


Introduction
------------

First of all, I will explain what globalization is. In general, the term globalization describes the process of international integration based on  the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. 

Major factors in globalization are advances in transportation and telecommunication infractructre. This includes the telegraph and nowadays the internet. They generate interdependency of economic and cultural activities. 

Globalization is changing the lives of millions of people around the world. It has positive and negative effects. In the following I will elaborate on topics related to globalization and consider some benefits and disadvantages for developed and developing countries.


Increased competition
---------------------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**(Better quality of products and services through increased competition)**


Domestic companies have to fight out foreign competition. They are forced to rise their product standards and their customer satisfaction levels. Only in this way they can  survive in the market.

And when an new brand enters a country, it has to fulfill many expectations the local customers have.

From these two facts improved quality of products and customer services is the result.


Advantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Globalization increases competition across state borders. This has the advantage that domestic companies are forced to rise their product and service standards. And foreign companies have to match local expectations.


Disadvantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disadvantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Foreign companies can misuse their financial overweight to dump products in a a contry and lead the local businesses to bankrupcy.


Employment
----------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In developing countries there is often a lack of capital which blocks the growth of domestic companies and the creation of  new employment.

With globalization, companies have entered developing countries and  generated employement for them.

Globalization has given the opportunity to invest in the emerging markets and activate the talents which are available there.

Disadvantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disadvantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One reason for my criticism is the explotation of workers.  They are treated unfairly by getting low paiment and working long hours, not to mention the bad safety measures in their factories and working places.

The outsourcing of jobs from developed countries to developing countries creates badly paid jobs under poor working conditions. At the same time jobs in developed countries get lost, where the working conditions are better. So that in the balance, the effect of uncontrolled globalization on the global job market is negative.


Foreign trade
-------------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The impact of foreign trade on a country is always positive because it forces it to compare itself to other countries. Through globalization this competition has become fairer. Organizations like the WTO have been established to keep the oversight on international trade,  so that civilized trade has become the generally accepted rule.

Through foreign trade, customers have access to a much wider range of products to choose from. Customers have a greater choice on the internet shopping sites as well as in the local markets just around the corner.

Advantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the aspect of foreign trade, customers are the winners of globalization. They have access to a much wider range of products to choose from. They have a better chance of finding the best relation between price and quality.


Disadvantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Disadvantages:short version

Another reason for my criticism is that a lot of comsumption goods are produced in developing countries. These products have to be transported to developed countries. Long transport routes cause a lot of CO2 emmissions, which is bad for the environment. Due to globalization and industrialization we have more choice of products, but because of this we produce too many goods we do not need, which is harmful for the environment too.

Foreign trade can push good traditional consumption habits out of the business scene of a country. In many cases they are substituted by comsumption habits that do not fit the local needs. One good example is the trend to lose local cooking and eating habits in favor of globalized, unhealthy ones. 


Conclusion
----------

Globalization certainly has brought the world a lot closer in terms of trade and economic cooperation. And it is also true that globalization itself delivers us the means to deal with its open issues in a constructive and creative way. But the sad fact is that we are not using these means effectively to limit or solve the many problems that the current process of globalization is causing. In my opinion global institutions, especially the UNO and its associated institutions like the WHO (World Health Organization) and the UNICEF should have much stronger financial and legal means to deal with global problems. Only in this way it is possible to meet the negative effects of globalization.
