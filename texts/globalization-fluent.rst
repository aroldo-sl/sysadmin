Globalization
=============

Introduction
------------

First of all, I will explain what globalization is.

Globalization stands for the process of increasing connectivity and interdependence of the world's markets and businesses. In its literal sense it means the transformation of local or regional phenomena into global ones. It has speeded up dramatically in the last two decades in different ways. The term Globalization is also used to refer to its economic, cultural and technological aspects.

Globalization is changing the lives of millions of people around the world. It has positive and negative effects. In the following I will elaborate on topics related to globalization and consider some benefits as well as disadvantages for developed and developing countries.

Arguments (pro and con)
-----------------------

Globalization increases competition across state borders. This has the advantage that domestic companies are forced to raise their product and service standards. And foreign companies have to match local expectations.

In developing countries there is often a lack of capital which blocks the growth of domestic companies and the creation of new employment. With globalization, companies have entered developing countries and generated employment for them. This gives the opportunity to invest in the emerging markets and activate the talents which are available there.
 
It may be a positive effect of foreign trade that, in some way,  customers are the winners of globalization. They have access to a much wider range of products to choose from. They have a better chance of finding the best relation between price and quality. Also they have a greater choice on the internet shopping sites as well as in the local markets just around the corner.

The impact of foreign trade on a country is often positive because it forces it to compare itself to other countries. Through globalization this competition has a chance of being fair. Organizations like the WTO have been established to keep the oversight on international trade, so that civilized trade could become the generally accepted rule.

On the other hand the outsourcing of jobs from developed countries to developing countries creates badly paid jobs under poor working conditions. At the same time jobs in developed countries get lost, where the working conditions are better. So that in the balance, the effect of uncontrolled globalization on the global job market is negative.

One aspect that must be criticized is the exploitation of workers in developing countries. They are treated unfairly by getting low payment and working long hours, not to mention the bad safety measures in their factories and working places.

Another reason for my criticism is that a lot of consumption goods that are produced in developing countries are used in developed countries. These products have to be transported to developed countries. Long transport routes cause a lot of CO2 emissions. Due to globalization and industrialization we have a larger choice of products, but because of this we produce too many goods we do not need. Overproduction is also a cause of littering the environment.

Foreign trade can drive traditional consumption habits out of focus in a country. In many cases they are replaced by consumption habits that do not fit the local needs. One good example is the trend to lose local cooking and eating habits in favour of the globalized, unhealthy ones that are often forstered by fast food chains.

Conclusion
----------

Globalization certainly has brought the world a lot closer in terms of trade and economic cooperation. And it is also true that globalization itself delivers us the means to deal with its open issues in a constructive and creative way. 

But the sad fact is that we are not using these means effectively to solve or limit the many problems that the current process of globalization is causing. In my opinion, global institutions, especially the UNO and similar institutions like the WHO (World Health Organization) and the UNICEF should have much stronger financial and legal means to deal with global problems. Only in this way it is possible to meet the negative effects of globalization.
