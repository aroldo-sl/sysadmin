Introduction
------------


What is globalization really up to?

Let us shed light on it all through this presentation.

The term globalization describes the process of international integration based on  the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. 

Major factors in globalization are advances in transportation and telecommunication infractructre. This includes the telegraph and nowadays the internet. They generate interdependency of economic and cultural activities. 

What do you think? Is globlalization good or bad? Development or degradation?


Globalization has  its challenges. But the role it  has played in changing the lives of millions of people around the world is mainly positive. 

The advantages of globalization can be noticed everywhere and a lot of developing countries are benefiting from it.   

In this presentation I am going to explain some of the positive points of globalization. 


Increased competition
---------------------


.. long title:

**(Better quality of products and services through increased competition)**


Domestic companies have to fight out foreign competition. They are forced to rise their product standards and their customer satisfaction levels. Only in this way they can  survive in the market.

And when an new brand enters a country, it has to fulfill many expectations the local customers have.

From these two facts improved quality of products and customer services is the result.


Can you give some examples of increased internation competition between companies?



Employment
----------

In developing countries there is often a lack of capital which blocks the growth of domestic companies and the creation of  new employment.


With globalization, companies have entered developing countries and  generated employement for them.

Globalization has given the opportunity to invest in the emerging markets and activate the talents which are available there.


Can you give an example of job creation through globalization? 


Foreign trade
-------------

The impact of foreign trade on a country is always positive because it forces it to compare itself to other countries. Through globalization this competition has become fairer. Organizations like the WTO have been established to keep the oversight on international trade,  so that civilized trade has become the generally accepted rule.

Through foreign trade, customers have access to a much wider range of products to choose from. Customers have a greater choice on the internet shopping sites as well as in the local markets just around the corner.


Spread of technical know-how
----------------------------

Due to globalization technical know-how has rapidly spread all over the world. This is a two-way flow of knowledge - from developed countries to developing countries but also the other way around. For instance, there is a great interest in Ayurveda and Yoga n the Western world, which are medical technologies from India. On the other hand, antibiotics have become common in India, saving and prolonging lives.

Other technologies have also been spreading very quickly, like mobile phones and tablets, causing a true revolution in communications in many countries. This makes researching for products and prices accessible and easy to everyone. And even nomads in the North African deserts travelling on their camels nowadays can use a GPRS tracker to find their way to the next Oasis.


Legal and ethical effects
-------------------------

In old days it was difficult to prosecute criminals across national borders. Nowadays, courts of justice in different countries cooperate making it more difficult for criminals to hide in a foregn country.

And in our globalized world there is an international  court of justice in den Haag which has the ability of prosecuting very powerful criminals from any country of the world. So that it is possible that one day even somebody like Syria's president Assad be prosecuted for his crimes.


Conclusion
----------

Even considering the open issues that globalization certainly has,  we can safely conclude that it has brought the world a lot closer in terms of trade and economic cooperation. And globalization itself delivers us the means to deal with its open issues in a constructive and creative way. We are on the way to give every country its due right independently from its economic and military status.
