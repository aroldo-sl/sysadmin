Introduction
------------


What is globalization really up to?

Let us shed light on it all through this comment.

The term globalization describes the process of international integration based on  the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. 

Major factors in globalization are advances in transportation and telecommunication infractructre. This includes the telegraph and nowadays the internet. They generate interdependency of economic and cultural activities. 

Globalization is changing the lives of millions of people around the world. It has positive and negative effects which I am going to consider in this comment.   

A lot of developed and developing countries are having benefits as well as disadvantages from it.   


Increased competition
---------------------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**(Better quality of products and services through increased competition)**


Domestic companies have to fight out foreign competition. They are forced to rise their product standards and their customer satisfaction levels. Only in this way they can  survive in the market.

And when an new brand enters a country, it has to fulfill many expectations the local customers have.

From these two facts improved quality of products and customer services is the result.

Advantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Globalization increases competition across state borders. This has the advantage that domestic companies are forced to rise their product and service standards. And foreign companies have to match local expectations.


Disadvantages:long version

Disadvantages:short version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Foreign companies can misuse their financial overweight to dump products in a a contry and lead the local businesses to bankrupcy.


Employment
----------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In developing countries there is often a lack of capital which blocks the growth of domestic companies and the creation of  new employment.

With globalization, companies have entered developing countries and  generated employement for them.

Globalization has given the opportunity to invest in the emerging markets and activate the talents which are available there.

Foreign trade
-------------

Advantages:long version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The impact of foreign trade on a country is always positive because it forces it to compare itself to other countries. Through globalization this competition has become fairer. Organizations like the WTO have been established to keep the oversight on international trade,  so that civilized trade has become the generally accepted rule.

Through foreign trade, customers have access to a much wider range of products to choose from. Customers have a greater choice on the internet shopping sites as well as in the local markets just around the corner.

Conclusion
----------

Even considering the open issues that globalization certainly has,  we can safely conclude that it has brought the world a lot closer in terms of trade and economic cooperation. And globalization itself delivers us the means to deal with its open issues in a constructive and creative way. We are on the way to give every country its due right independently from its economic and military status.
